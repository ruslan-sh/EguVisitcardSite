						<p>Sugrivik News reporters have published their investigation of the corruption in the ranks of the <strong>UEF</strong> officials. It turns out that Frank Moss, Head of the EG Main HQ customs service, as well as two of his deputy and several captains of supply ships were in touch with <strong>The Family</strong>. Journalists were able to identify a scheme whereby toxic waste was imported into the system. Smuggled goods were being delivered to the <strong>Popovich</strong> station, where ships carrying supplies for the operational purposes of the main system outposts were forwarding it to <strong>EG Main HQ</strong>. Then the ships supplying the small research outposts at <strong>EG Prime</strong> were dumping the waste to the planet surface.</p>
						<p>A spokesman for <strong>UEF</strong> said that currently Moss and others mentioned by Sugrivik News were suspended from their posts and put under house arrest. All available evidence are being verified.</p>
						<p>A small informative note:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>As many of you know <strong>EG Prime</strong> is still not colonized. The main population of the system resides in <strong>EG Main HQ</strong> and other stations. This is mainly due to the rather meager allocation of funds by the federal government, since most of funds were allocated to Sugrivik, the system opened up ten years earlier. During all these years after the system discovery and construction of the <strong>Popovich</strong> station, only four research stations were built at <strong>EG Prime</strong>: Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Each station is designed for 50-100 people capacity. Alpha and Beta were built by <strong>Euryale Solutions</strong> and <strong>Future of Euryale</strong>. Gamma and Delta built by <strong>Colonial Drones</strong> together with <strong>Euryale Exchange</strong>. There is a rumor that The <strong>Family</strong> possesses few bases on the surface as well, but there is no reliable evidence of that.</p>
							<p>The main processing and production facilities, as well as the headquarters of <strong>Colonial Drones</strong>, are located on the <strong>EG Main HQ</strong> station.</p>

							<p>КAs it became well known to our viewers through the last six months and more, news from Euryale system stirs up our region of space. First, one gang of bandits, hiding behind the high slogans and alleged support of the people, staged an armed coup and, despite the best efforts of the democratically elected government, they were able to capture EG Main HQ. After that they invaded Ullese, incited the station workers to rebellion and  attacked Ullese Natural Limited security service taking over Roche Works! Empire tried to hush up the case, saying that the security forces Natural Limited "allegedly" not adequately responded to the protests of workers and supported the actions of United Euryale First. A very strange twist, is it not? While Empire, as a matter of fact, lost its control over Ullese.</p>
							<p>Then, apparently not willing to share with his former crime accomplices, their leader founded a new group, and being covered by the same slogans about the corruption and venality of the authorities he put a massacre at EG Main and its surroundings! After coming through all the shock, people are now dragging out their miserable existence on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe. Attempts by the federal government to agree on humanitarian aid deliveries to Euryale were unsuccessful.</p>
							<p>Yet again, these bandits manage to persuade the Empire represented by Empire Assembly in Putamasin to sell them Baffin Gateway! And then the question arises: why the Empire supports such barbaric regimes on its borders?</p>
							<p>And now, under the false pretext of protecting "their" people on Baffin Gateway as well as supply convoys, what the irony, from pirate attacks, EGU brings their Expeditionary Corps into Putamasin. Of course the security forces and the federal system of the fleet could not close our eyes to this and attacked ships violators! But EGU, using provocateurs as before, started a riot at Weil Orbital. Unfortunately, there were not enough security forces to ensure order on the station and the federal fleet had to retreat in order to prevent civilian casualties.</p>
							<p>However, the fleet, together with the security forces of PLI carried out a brilliant operation on the results of which we have reported previously.</p>
							<p>Our analysts expect that without its "Corps" EG Union regime will fall in the next month and as Euryale is freed from that gang, democracy and the law will prevail again!</p>

						<p>Euryale Today reports that FNS O'Brien was seriously damaged immediately after dropping from the warp into the conflict zone, and was forced to flee the system. Also they tell the story by sergeant Neville Pullovsky, one of the pilots of the Fourth Squadron of Expeditionary Corps who was watching the event:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>So, me and my mate, Mikhalych, sat down on the tail of one cobra and started diggin’ holes in her, huh. She wiggles-wobbles, kicking her afterburners trying to drop us, but we kept it tight. Long story short, Mikhalych was lucky to shot it right into the power plant and it stalled. Well, we went for a laser walk on her guns a coupla times and then left alone.</p>
							<p>Now we were planning to return to the main bunch, and then the onboard computer just went crazy. Like a shot we figured that something biggie jumps down right on or head and took it to the heels. Retreated for two and a half clicks, dropped heatsink and went adrift. Here, this fat carcass starts to fall in. Sure thing, I had seen cruisers, but not this close. All in all, he completed the jump and headed towards the main scrum. We have scanned it by passive sensors and were going to steal a march on it by fetching an arc, so to warn our pals, as we saw a series of flashes from one of the engines and a couple at the bow of the ship. Bang, and the ship began to heel on the left side with one of the engines clearly misfiring. In about a minute or two a Hauler launched from it and started to burn a rubber at full speed as a wing of condors went after him. Hardpoints deployed, clearly keen to knock him down. Well, me and Mikhalych, without second thought we started to chase them. They were so carelessly busy that we immediately cut out a couple. The remaining two went down shortly after that, apparently some rookie pilots. By the time we were done that Hauler already commited a jump. Mikhalych said that we gotta move away from the cruiser while it has not launched fighters, as he just started turning in our direction. Well, we circuited him by the radar limit and went to our crowd. Since that we didn’t see it.</p>

						<p>Euryale Today выпустила первую часть репортажа о Семье и черном рынке в Euryale.</p>
						<p>“Еще со времен, когда у власти был президент Малкольм Джей Джонсон, предшественник Гийома Леду, жители Euryale знали, что на Grantt Enterprise можно купить практически все. Почти сразу после постройки станция перешла под контроль Семьи. Ходили слухи, что ради этого они проспонсировали избирательную кампанию Джонсона, но прямых доказательств найти так и не удалось.</p>
						<p>Grantt Enterprise расположена на самых задворках системы и вращается вокруг десятой планеты.</p>
						<p>Такое удаленное расположение, положение орбиты Euryale 10, а так же не полное покрытие системы спутниками слежения, позволяло разного рода личностям провозить нелегальные грузы, как в систему, так и из нее. Grantt Enterprise стала складом нелегальных товаров на пути к таким густонаселенным системам как Sugrivik, LHS 1020, LTT 700, Zelano и конечно Synteini.</p>
						<p>Позже Семье удалось подмять под себя рынок на Taylor Barracks, что позволило получать доходы с большинства сделок в системе и обосноваться на научной станции Popovich. Тем самым обеспечив себе легкодоступный склад для нелегальных грузов.</p>
